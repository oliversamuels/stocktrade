# Dynamic User and Admin Dashboard App

## Background:
Our startup has given 10 stock traders $100 each to trade. We want a dashboard where each trader can track their profit or loss overtime (data point at 1 minute interval). We also want an admin dashboard where the manager can track the performance of the 10 traders.

## Step-by-step instructions:

### Step 1:
Use a random number generator to simulate the profit and loss on the $100 given to each trader.

### Step 2.
Create a MongoDB database for this data.

### Step 3.
Create a user dashboard. The dashboard should at least include a graph of the profit (or loss) vs time (data point at 1 minute intervals).
(Tip: profit and loss on the y-axis and timestamp on the x-axis).

### Step 4.
Create an admin dashboard.
